## Photography-Site
- This is my personal photography website to be included in my portfolio.
- Website name: Ambient Light Photography

Published: https://fungible123.github.io/Photography-Site/

### Design

- I designed my layout in Figma. 
- Check out the design here: https://www.figma.com/file/Wiz8s1P5OFbBJsItCB5Jw9A2/Photography-Site?node-id=0%3A1

### Technologies:

#### Github
 - Used github pages to publish the website

#### Bootstrap
 - Used Boottrap framework to build the photography site.

#### Gulp
 - Used Gulp to make some automations on the dependencies and sass compiling.
 
#### SASS
 - Used SASS to style the website
 
#### jQuery
 - Used jQuery to make the website interactive with animations and effects.

### Remarks:

#### Bootstrap
 - Pretty straightforward to use. You just have to patient with reading the documentation and finding what you need.

#### Gulp
 - Had some issues with the gulpfile code as the version 4 of Gulp has just released so there were a few changes to the source code. 
 
#### SASS
 - Its pretty much like CSS but you need to know what properties to override if your using a framework and make it work in SASS.
 
#### jQuery
 - Used a combination of Vanilla Javascript and jQuery but its an ease to use plug-ins in jQuery.
